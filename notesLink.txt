[Problem]: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/?envType=list&envId=ph9f65i7
[Pattern]: keep adding and always find the max
[Tips]: Find the next num and then find the max of the resulting till now. It's like find the max of all the all no till no will be stored in max, now when i see the new no, find the exact no and now compare if the newly formed no is the max or now. Very sismilar to what i would have done manually.

[Problem]: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/?envType=list&envId=ph9f65i7
[Pattern]: 2 loops, oue out, other in to match
[Tips]: The inisde for loop should go till haystack.len-needle.len because inside this for loop again i will go from o to len of needle.

[Problem]: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/
[Pattern]: Add and check max
[Tips]: Remember it's not about reaching the last index exactly, it's just about reaching the finish line. The only time it can not reach is when the index where its stands is greater than reachable limit, (this is how it's designed)

[Problem]:  https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/?envType=list&envId=ph9f65i7
[Pattern]: Trick
[Tips]: Have a list of valid nums and associated char; here i used a switch ; List no used like in Num to Roman since we will not loop the num list. Here Add or Substract both can happen. Use a LL/Stack; We need to keep the value.

[Problem]: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/?envType=list&envId=ruypfpvi
[Pattern]: Modify links of LL
[Tips]: Once we reset the pointers, other nodes will still be pointing to the LL, but since they are not in our line when we accesusing head, we will ignore them.
