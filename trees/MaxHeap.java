// A min-heap is a complete binary tree (that is, totally filled other than the rightmost elements on the last
// level) where each node is smaller than its children. The root, therefore, is the minimum element in the tree.
// We have two key operations on a min-heap: insert and extract_min. 

// in min heap we insert the new element in right most spot. 
// then we switch its positio with its parent. to find it's correct place.
